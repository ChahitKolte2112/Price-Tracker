# Price-Tracker

We are planning to build a web application where a user can track the prices of the product from online shopping sites and can also get notified when there is any offer applied or price drop on the product through application itself or through Email.

This product will reduce the Hassle of going to different sites for checking the product price and will automate the things and will notify the user about the product price and now he can easily add his product and relax, and our app will be sending the notification to him.
